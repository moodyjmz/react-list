# React List

An attempt to make a small app to pull trending github repos.

The focus for this is to do things reasonably quickly.

It can be run via 

`npm run dev`

tested, via

`npm run test`

Things I am not happy with and would change:

- CSS vs SASS, this is a choice, however I feel hampered by CSS alone
- Tests, there is not enough testing
- Organisation of TS types and interfaces - this is not uniform and grew organically
- Lack of suspense or error boundaries
- No live build - no actions added for GH pages
- Design is a bit bland, buttons are not nice - I didn't add a UI library to keep it simple
- Alias paths give warnings in VSC, although they build fine
