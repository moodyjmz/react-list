This is a sample project. The aim is to list popular github repos and allow the user to favourite them in local storage. The project is to use best practices and be high performance, using latest react features regarding suspense and error handling. It is to use tan query. It should be modular and designed to be readily testable using RTK. It should have tests for RTK added. It should be made using vite and use vitest.

This is for the frontend and should not use require. Any imports should be done at the top of the page, not inside functions.

Where appropriate, use memoization or other performance features.

Use single quotes only in TypeScript code vs double quotes. Do not do this for HTML content or JSON config.

Ensure that HTML markup respects A11Y and uses semantic HTML for content.

Prefer simple, reusable code over complex code.
